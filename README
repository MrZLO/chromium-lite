 Chromium-lite build system (by Tarnyko <tarnyko@tarnyko.net>)
 **************************

An attempt to cut down Chromium, and make it more comprehensive,
by doing the following :

- extracting Linux-only sources (removing MacOS, Win32, Android...
                                 source files);
- linking with system libraries (system libnss instead of local
                                 Google BoringSSL e.g.);
- configuring with CMake instead of Gyp ;
- compiling with GCC instead of Clang/LLVM ;
- disabling unneeded optimizations ;
- making debugging easier.


 Packages :
 --------

01a) base

 General-purpose toolkit (somewhat equivalent to GNOME GLib or QtCore).
 * Depends on : libevent, libicui18n
 * Handles : logging, callbacks, string and numeral conversions,
             command line arguments, file and directory operations,
             message loops, threads, time and date...
 * Notes : the full "base::i18n" subclass uses a fork of libicui18n
           in "third_party/icu"; to avoid using it, we omit building
           2 source files in the "i18n" subfolder.

01b) skia

 Low-level drawing API (somewhat equivalent to Cairo or EFL Evas).
 * Depends on :
   - libjpeg-turbo, libpng12, libgif, libwebp (image formats)
   - freetype, fontconfig (font drawing)
   - egl, glesv2 (wayland) / gl, glu, x11 (x11) / osmesa (software)
 * Handles : basic drawing, text drawing, image formats conversion,
             GL acceleration and shaders.
 * Notes : upstream Skia is in "third_party/skia", but Chromium needs
           additional source files in "skia/ext", and also specific
           macros (look for "Chromium-specific" in CMakeLists.txt)

01c) v8

 V8 JavaScript Engine (somewhat equivalent to Mozilla Spidermonkey).
 * Depends on :
   - libicui18n
   - python (for building only)
 * Handles : JavaScript parsing, compilation and optimization.

02a) url

 URL parsing.
 * Depends on : base, libicuuc
 * Handles : recognition of URLs validity/protocol/scheme/content.

02b) crypto

 Cryptographic helper library.
 * Depends on : base, libnss
 * Handles : hashing, certificate creation and validation,
             randomization, encryption.
 * Notes : there are 2 implementations : NSS and OpenSSL.
           The OpenSSL one, despite its name, only works with
           Google-forked BoringSSL, thus we use NSS instead.

02c) ipc

 IPC helper library.
 * Depends on : base
 * Handles : socket-based message passing.

02d) gpu_command_buffer

 GPU command helper library.
 * Depends on : base
 * Handles : small utility functions to get/set GL properties,
             group GL commands and mark them...
 * Notes : we can not rely on system Mesa to build it, because
           it uses very recent and sometimes Chromium-specific
           GL header definitions internally.

03a) net

 Net helper library.
 * Depends on :
   - base, url, crypto, protobuf, libnss, libnspr
   - python, protobuf-compiler (for building only)
 * Handles : this huge library is at the core of Chromium's
             recognition of various protocols (HTTP://, FTP://,
             FILE://, SPDY, WebSockets...) and also serves as a
             toolkit for various browser-oriented mechanisms such
             as cache and cookies management, DNS resolving,
             proxy settings, SSL certificate recognition...
 * Notes : cryptographic code, when it does not depend on crypto
           (see above) has 2 implementations : NSS and OpenSSL.
           OpenSSL, despite its name, requires Google BoringSSL,
           thus we use NSS. Though, it requires extensions such
           as "CK_NSS_AEAD_PARAMS" which are not merged in NSS yet
           (see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=917571),
           thus we also build sources in "third_party/nss" for now.

03d) ui_gfx

 UI Gfx helper library.
 * Depends on :
   - base, skia, ipc, libjpeg-turbo, harfbuzz
   - x11, xi (x11)
 * Handles : intermediate drawing helper API between Views toolkit
             (see below) and Skia. Can easily convert to PNG/JPEG,

04a) ozone

 Ozone library.
 * Depends on : wayland-client, wayland-cursor, wayland-egl, egl,
                xkbcommon
 * Handles : Ozone is an alternative backend to X11 under Linux ;
             we only build its Wayland implementation, though a
             DRM implementation (for ChromeOS ?) exists somewhere.
             You have no reason to compile this under X11.

04d) ui_events

 UI Events helper library.
 * Depends on :
   - base, skia, ipc, ui_gfx, xkbcommon
   - libudev (wayland) / x11, xi, xproto (x11)
 * Handles : hardware detection, keyboard events, motion and gesture
             detection. Basically, this library uses platform-specific
             APIs (XInput under X11, UDev under Ozone/Wayland) to
             handle keyboard, mouse, touch... events.
 * Notes : the Ozone implementation can also support "evdev", but this
           seems to be required only by the higher-level Ozone DRM
           backend, which we do not build (see above).
