 Chromium-lite build system (by Tarnyko <tarnyko@tarnyko.net>)
 **************************

An attempt to cut down Chromium, and make it more comprehensive,
by doing the following :

- extracting Linux-only sources (removing MacOS, Win32, Android...
                                 source files);
- linking with system libraries (system libnss instead of local
                                 Google BoringSSL e.g.);
- configuring with CMake instead of Gyp ;
- compiling with GCC instead of Clang/LLVM ;
- disabling unneeded optimizations.

 Packages :
 --------

01a) base

 General-purpose toolkit (somewhat equivalent to GNOME GLib or QtCore).
 * Depends on : libevent, libicui18n
 * Handles : logging, callbacks, string and numeral conversions,
             command line arguments, file and directory operations,
             message loops, threads, time and date...
 * Notes : the full "base::i18n" subclass uses a fork of libicui18n
           in "third_party/icu"; to avoid using it, we omit 2 source
           files in the "i18n" subfolder.

01b) skia

 Low-level drawing API (somewhat equivalent to Cairo or EFL Evas).
 * Depends on :
   - libjpeg-turbo, libpng12, libgif, libwebp (image formats)
   - freetype, fontconfig (font drawing)
   - egl, glesv2 (wayland) / gl, glu, x11 (x11) / osmesa (software)
 * Handles : basic drawing, image formats conversion, GL acceleration
             and shaders.
 * Notes : upstream Skia is in "third_party/skia", but Chromium needs
           additional source files in "skia/ext", and also specific
           macros (look for "Chromium-specific" in CMakeLists.txt)

02a) url

 URL parsing.
 * Depends on : base, libicuuc
 * Handles : recognition of URLs validity/protocol/scheme/content.

02b) crypto

 Cryptographic helper library.
 * Depends on : base, libnss
 * Handles : hashing, certificate creation and validation,
             randomization, encryption.

02d) ui_gfx

 UI Gfx helper library.
 * Depends on :
   - base, skia, libjpeg-turbo, harfbuzz
   - x11, x1 (x11)
