 Chromium-lite build system (by Tarnyko <tarnyko@tarnyko.net>)
 **************************

An attempt to cut down Chromium, and make it more comprehensive,
by doing the following :

- extracting Linux-only sources (removing MacOS, Win32, Android...
                                 source files);
- linking with system libraries (system libnss instead of local
                                 Google BoringSSL e.g.);
- configuring with CMake instead of Gyp ;
- compiling with GCC instead of Clang/LLVM ;
- disabling unneeded optimizations ;
- making debugging easier.


 How to clone the source :
 -----------------------
To grab the whole Chromium source I am using (it is around 12 GB,
thus schedule accordingly) :

$ git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git
$ export PATH="$PWD/depot_tools:$PATH"
$ gclient config https://github.com/Tarnyko/chromium-lite.git \
 --name=chromium-lite --deps-file DEPS
$ gclient sync --nohooks

 How to build :
 ------------
 Relatively to the cloning root tree, here is the root folder of each package :
01a-base) base
01b-skia) third_party/skia
01c-v8) v8
02a-url) url
02b-crypto) crypto
02c-ipc) ipc
02d-sdch) sdch
02e-gpu_command_buffer) gpu/command_buffer
03a-net) net
03d-ui) ui/gfx
04a-ozone) ozone
04d-ui_events) ui/events
05a-media) media
05b-ui_base) ui/base
06b-ui_gl) ui/gl
07b-gpu) gpu
08a-cc) cc
09a-blink) third_party/WebKit/Source

 For each "recipe", please copy it this folder the "CMakeList.txt" file,
and any .cmake and .patch file present.
 Then, move to it, and apply the patches with :
$ patch -p0 < <patchfile>
 Finally, build the package :
$ mkdir Build ; cd Build
$ cmake ..
 (for Skia :
$ cmake .. -DBACKEND=GLX -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../Toolchain-x86_64.cmake
 for others :
$ cmake .. -DBACKEND=X11 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../Toolchain-x86_64.cmake
)


 Packages :
 --------

01a) base

 General-purpose toolkit (somewhat equivalent to GNOME GLib or QtCore).
 * Depends on :
   - libevent, libicui18n
   - python (for building only)
 * Handles : logging, callbacks, string and numeral conversions,
             command line arguments, file and directory operations,
             message loops, threads, time and date...
 * Notes : the full "base::i18n" subclass requires a fork of libicui
           in "third_party/icu"; to avoid this, we patch 1 file and use
           the forked headers for the other one ("net" requires it).

01b) v8

 V8 JavaScript Engine (somewhat equivalent to Mozilla Spidermonkey).
 * Depends on :
   - libicui18n
   - python (for building only)
 * Handles : JavaScript parsing, compilation and optimization.

02a) url

 URL parsing.
 * Depends on : base, libicuuc
 * Handles : recognition of URLs validity/protocol/scheme/content.

02b) crypto

 Cryptographic helper library.
 * Depends on : base, libnss
 * Handles : hashing, certificate creation and validation,
             randomization, encryption.
 * Notes : there are 2 implementations : NSS and OpenSSL.
           The OpenSSL one, despite its name, only works with
           Google-forked BoringSSL, thus we use NSS instead.
           We also patch it to backport the "LoadNSSLibraries"
           function, which is used a lot later by one of our
           NSS-related patches for "content_browser" (see below,
           and see https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium
              /src/+/ee55ed44da66cc54b3d5ab295485b7bbf3c0716a).

02c) sql

 SQL helper library.
 * Depends on : base, sqlite3
 * Handles : a thin wrapper around SQLite3, which Google forked
             to add the custom "recoverVtableInit()" function
             (but we avoid it by using a macro).

02d) gin

 Gin helper library.
 * Depends on : base, v8
 * Handles : a set of utility functions on top of V8. Mostly
             used by Blink for wrapping V8 generated bindings,
             and at a high level by Content Shell.

02e) gpu_command_buffer

 GPU command helper library.
 * Depends on : base
 * Handles : small utility functions to get/set GL properties,
             group GL commands and mark them...
 * Notes : we can not rely on system Mesa to build it, because
           it uses Chromium-specific GL headers definitions.

03a) net

 Net helper library.
 * Depends on :
   - base, url, crypto, sql
   - protobuf, libnss, libnspr, open-vcdiff
   - python, protobuf-compiler (for building only)
 * Handles : this huge library is at the core of Chromium's
             recognition of various protocols (HTTP://, FTP://,
             FILE://, SPDY, HTTP/2, WebSockets...) and also serves
             as a toolkit for various browser-oriented mechanisms
             such as cache and cookies management, DNS resolving,
             proxy settings, SSL certificate recognition...
 * Notes : cryptographic code, when it does not depend on crypto
           (see above) has 2 implementations : NSS and OpenSSL.
           OpenSSL, despite its name, requires Google BoringSSL,
           thus we use NSS. Though, it requires non-upstream
           features such as "TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305"
           (see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=917571),
           thus we patch a few sources to remove it - and also
           include forked headers from "third_party/nss".

04a) mojo

 Mojo IPC and bindings library.
 * Depends on :
   - base, url, crypto, net
   - python (for building only)
 * Handles : Mojo is an effort to describe interfaces in a generic
             way in .mojom files, and automatically generate C++/
             JavaScript/Java bindings for them. It is mostly used
             by the "ipc" and "content_browser" libraries (see below).

04b) storage

 Storage library.
 * Depends on : base, url, sql, net, leveldb
 * Handles : on top of "sql", but with an added dependency to the
             external leveldb package (why doesn't it live within
             "sql" directly ?), storage is an abstraction layer
             for browser database storage.
 * Notes : storage requires headers from Google's leveldb fork in
           "third_party/leveldatabase" to be built, but not at
           runtime. This allows us to rely on system leveldb.
           We also build additional Chromium-specific sources,
           which require the R2 ("third_party/r2") as well.

05a) ipc

 IPC helper library.
 * Depends on :
   - base, mojo
   - python (for building only)
 * Handles : socket-based message passing. Although it can be
             be built without Mojo support (see above), its
             Mojo bindings are heavily used by final
             "content_browser" (see below) to do IPC stuff.

05b) skia

 Low-level drawing API (somewhat equivalent to Cairo or EFL Evas).
 * Depends on :
   - mojo
   - libjpeg-turbo, libpng12, libgif, libwebp (image formats)
   - freetype, fontconfig (font drawing)
   - egl, glesv2 (wayland) / gl, glu, x11 (x11) / osmesa (software)
   - python (for building only)
 * Handles : basic drawing, text drawing, image formats conversion,
             GL acceleration and shaders.
 * Notes : upstream Skia is in "third_party/skia", but Chromium needs
           additional source files in "skia/ext", and also specific
           macros (look for "Chromium-specific" in CMakeLists.txt)
           It requires Mojo, just to build a few Mojo bindings which
           will be used later by "content_browser" (see below).

06a) ui_gfx

 UI Gfx helper library.
 * Depends on :
   - base, mojo, ipc, skia, libjpeg-turbo, harfbuzz
   - x11, xi (x11)
   - python (for building only)
 * Handles : intermediate drawing helper API between Views toolkit
             (see below) and Skia. Can easily convert to PNG/JPEG,
             draw text, set bounds...
 * Notes : It requires Mojo, just to build a few Mojo bindings which
           will be used later by "content_browser" (see below).

07a) ui_accessibility

 UI Accessibility helper library.
 * Depends on :
   - base, ui_gfx, gconf, atk
   - python (for building only)

07b) ui_events

 UI Events helper library.
 * Depends on :
   - base, skia, ipc, ui_gfx, xkbcommon
   - libudev (wayland) / x11, xi, xproto, libevent (x11)
 * Handles : hardware detection, keyboard events, motion and gesture
             detection. Basically, this library uses platform-specific
             APIs (XInput under X11, UDev under Ozone/Wayland) to
             handle keyboard, mouse, touch... events.
 * Notes : the Ozone implementation may also support "evdev", but this
           seems to be required only by the higher-level Ozone DRM
           backend, which we do not build (see above).

07c) ozone

 Ozone library.
 * Depends on : base, skia, ui_gfx, wayland-client, wayland-cursor,
                wayland-egl, egl, xkbcommon
 * Handles : Ozone is an alternative backend to X11 under Linux ;
             we only build its Wayland implementation, though a
             DRM implementation (for ChromeOS ?) exists somewhere.
             You have no reason to compile Ozone under X11.

08a) ui_base

 UI Base helper library.
 * Depends on :
   - base, url, net, skia, ui_gfx, ui_events, ui_strings, ui_resources

08b) media

 Media library.
 * Depends on :
   - base, url, crypto, gpu_command_buffer, skia, ui_gfx, ui_events
   - alsa, opus
   - ozone (wayland) / x11, xdamage, xext, xfixes, xtst (x11)
   - yasm (for building on x86/x86_64 only)
 * Handles :
 * Notes : "libwebm" and "libyuv" are supposed to be dependecies,
           but libwebm .RPM/.DEB packages are nowhere to be found,
           and required libyuv is pretty different from the version
           found publicly. We are thus putting "third_party/libwebm"
           and "third_party/libyuv" code directly in the binary.
           PS : MIDI implementation could pull udev, but we avoid it.

09a) ui_gl

 UI GL helper library.
 * Depends on :
   - base, gpu_command_buffer, skia, ui_gfx, ui_base
 * Handles : various OpenGL utility functions.

10a) gpu

 GPU library.
 * Depends on :
   - base, crypto, gpu_command_buffer, ipc, ui_gfx, ui_gl
   - python, protobuf-compiler (for building only)
 * Handles : code for Chromium's "GPU process" lives there ; it is
             responsible for detecting GPU OpenGL capabilities,
             initializing the GL renderer and fallbacking to the
             software renderer if necessary, and starting the
             dedicated GPU Zygote process.
 * Notes : lots of third-parties are living inside this binary,
           including ANGLE (converts D3D->OpenGL, but required ?),
           RE2 (regular expressions), SMhasher (custom hashes) and
           libXNVCTRL (specific NVidia extensions under X11).

11a) cc

 CC library:
 * Depends on :
   - base, skia, ui_gfx, ui_events, media, ui_gl, gpu
   - protobuf
   - python, protobuf-compiler (for building only)
 * Handles : code for Chromium's "Renderer process" lives there ;
             it is the last abstraction layer between drawing
             libraries (from above : UI Views, UI Gfx, Skia) and
             the GPU process above which will do the real drawing.
             It starts the dedicated Renderer Zygote process.

12a) blink

 Blink Web Engine, Google's fork of WebKit.
 * Depends on :
   - base, v8, url, gin, skia, ui_gfx, gpu, cc
   - libicui18n>=52, libicuuc>=52, harfbuzz>=0.9.22, libwebp>=0.4.0,
     libxml2, libxslt
   - python, gperf, bison (for building only)
   - yasm (for building on x86/x86_64 only)
 * Handles : Web rendering.
             Bindings with the V8 JavaScript engine (see above) are
             written in .idl files, and then converted to C++ at
             build time to be compiled in the final binary.
 * Notes : hard-to-find third-parties such as QCMS (fork of
           Mozilla TinyCMS) and OTS (security layer for TrueType
           fonts decoding) are included directly inside the binary.

12b) ui_compositor

 UI Compositor helper library.
 * Depends on : base, skia, ui_gfx, ui_gl, gpu, cc

13a) gpu_blink

 GPU Blink library.
 * Depends on : base, skia, ui_gfx, ui_gl, gpu, cc, blink

13b) ui_events_blink

 UI Events Blink library.
 * Depends on : ui_gfx, ui_events, cc, blink

13c) ui_aura

 UI Aura library.
 * Depends on : base, skia, ui_gfx, ui_events, ui_base,
                ui_compositor, ui_resources
 * Handles : Aura is the new abstraction layer between Views (see
             below) and the platform, which, on ChromeOS, happens
             to be a full-fledged window manager ; here it limits
             its role in dispatching events between various Views
             windows, managing z-order, etc.
             Funny part is, even with Aura, Views still needs X11
             libraries for custom stuff :).

14c) ui_shell_dialogs

 UI Shell Dialogs library.
 * Depends on : base, ui_strings, skia, ui_base, ui_aura

15a) content_browser

 Content Browser library.
 * Depends on :
   - base, url, net, mojo, storage, ipc, skia, ui_gfx
     ui_accessibility, ui_events, media, ui_base, ui_gl,
     gpu, cc, blink, gpu_blink, ui_events_blink, ui_aura,
     ui_touch_selection, ui_snapshot, ui_shell_dialogs
   - ozone (wayland) / x11, xcomposite, pangocairo (x11)
   - libnss, minizip
 * Handles : Content Browser is the "real" browser code; it
             leverages Blink, which itself leverages V8 (see above)
             to do HTML/CSS/JS rendering.
 * Notes : the Zygote (Linux process pre-forking) source file tries
           to use a Google BoringSSL call, we patch it back to NSS
           (see https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+
               /10eda64c1a5c673dcdca74fbb774f522dc253ad7); this
           also requires a patch directly in "crypto" (see above).
            The "child" subcomponent uses another component named
           "webcrypto" which has been totally switched to BoringSSL
           (see https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+
               /039e410f3023fe89b5156500e6f6e323b7221f88); we
           backport its full former NSS implementation.
            We also remove calls to low-level battery, vibration,
           and bluetooth libraries, which we do not build nor need.
            This is a forked call to "zip::ZipWithFilterCallback",
           we build 1 file from a fork of zlib ("third_party/zlib")
           to have that.
            The "net" code uses additional functions than the ones
           "net/mime_util.cc", thus we have an extra "mime_util.cc",
            We build the Scheduler, Tracing, Sandbox and Google APIs
           third-parties directly in the binary.

16a) ui_views

 UI Views toolkit.
 * Depends on :
   - base, url, skia, ui_gfx, ui_accessibility, ui_events, ui_base,
     ui_compositor, ui_aura, ui_strings, ui_resources
   - ozone (wayland) / x11, xext, xrandr, atk (x11)
   - libicu
 * Views is the real Chromium toolkit, feature-equivalent to GTK+,
   Elementary or QtWidgets. It leverages the whole lower-level
   UI libraries to create and handle buttons, menus, text fields,
   scrollbars, dialog boxes... and react to user input.
   Built with "content_browser" support (see above), it features
   the most-wanted WebView widget !

-------------------

 Optional packages :
 *****************

02f) sdch

 SDCH library.
 * Depends on : base
 * Handles : SDCH is Google's implementation of the VCDIFF
             format, based on open-vcdiff, and used for
             delta encoding in HTTP communications.


-------------------

(NOTES :
 1) "sdch" is only used by "net", "gin" by "content_shell"...

 2) CentOS7 users : the versions of libicu, harfbuzz and libwebp
    shipped by your distribution are too old to build Blink :(.
    You will find in the "z_centos7" updated RPMs, which have
    been verified to work.
